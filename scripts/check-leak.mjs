/**
 * Vocabulary tripwire.
 *
 * This repository restates an approach developed elsewhere; the approach
 * travelled, the source material did not. This check enforces that mechanically
 * on every push, because a rule nobody can verify is a rule that decays.
 *
 * ## Why the words are not in this file
 *
 * They used to be, and that was the bug. This repository is public, so a
 * denylist naming the former employer's services published the exact list it
 * existed to suppress — an index of what to look for, helpfully annotated with
 * `a disallowed term`. The check was leaking its own subject.
 *
 * So the terms live in `.leakwords.json`, which is gitignored and never
 * published. What stays here are the *structural* patterns — a JWT, a real
 * secret, a real-looking email — because those describe shapes rather than
 * names, and publishing "we refuse hardcoded JWTs" tells an onlooker nothing
 * they could use.
 *
 * Without that file the check still runs and still fails on structure; it says
 * loudly that the word list is absent rather than passing in silence, because
 * a tripwire that quietly checks nothing is worse than none at all.
 *
 * ## Matching
 *
 * Word terms are matched loosely on purpose. The original rules were written as
 * `\bword\b`, which matches the bare word and misses `wordService`,
 * `word_service` and `WordService` — the forms a word actually takes once it
 * reaches code, and so the ones most likely to carry it in. Each term is
 * expanded to tolerate camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case, any separator and any
 * suffix, so one entry covers the whole family.
 *
 * A check that cries wolf on line one gets ignored by line two, so terms must
 * still be specific enough to be meaningless outside their source. If a term
 * ever fires on innocent code, narrow the term rather than renaming the code.
 *
 * This repo carries one risk its companion does not: it copies a UI. Layout
 * and spacing are craft and may travel; a brand colour is identity and may not.
 * So the palette is checked, not just the words.
